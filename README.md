Simon Game

In this project i decided to make a simple memory game. I wanted to create a traditional Simon game. I have decided to use a circle for the game and split
it into four different coloured buttons. I then want a smaller circle in the middle to put the controls in. Every time a button is pressed i want the button
to flash and play a sound so it is clear a button has been pressed. I am going to use a random function so that the computer will randomise the sequence 
each time the game is reset. I am going to use 'relaxed' and 'strict' modes for the user to choose from. Also th game will have a start and reset button.
When the player either wins or looses the computer is going to output an alert to the user.

UX

First of all i tried to do my html page and CSS as i wanted to get an overall look of the game to go off. I decided to have a pale pink background and primary
colours for the buttons 'red', 'yellow', 'green' and 'blue'. Once i had created the style of the game i then decided to create the JavaScript to go with it. I
had struggled for a while to know what was the best code to use. Once i had created my JavaScript i needed help because nothing was working. We realised i was
naming any ids for variables in my html. Once we had started to get somewhere everything started to come together. I had to change some of my html and css to
make the overall look of the game good. I know the typical actions the user would want to perform such as 'resetting the game' , 'starting the game' and
'changing' the mode of the game. I also would think the user would want it to be obvious when a button is pressed so i think it is important i add flashes and
sounds to the buttons in the sequences. The users would also want to know what level their on so i would want to have a level section in the controls bit so the
user can see their level at all times.

Features

-In this project the buttons flash and make sounds when pressed on.
-You can change the mode from 'relaxed' to 'strict'.
-You can reset the game throughout the game.
-I have used a random function which will allow the game to use a unique sequence each time.
-I have used 'start' and 'reset' buttons to let the user have control of the game.

Technologies Used

JQuery - I have used jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation
Bootsrap - I have used bootsrap for icons and effects
Font Awesome - I have used font awesome to add some different font onto my website.
CSS - For styling the game
HTML - For the elements of the game

#Testing

-Does the game start when pressed the start button?
-Does the levels section go up each time your on a new level?
-Does the game play the random sequence for you to then press the correct button?
-Does the game move on to the next level when completed last level correctly?
-Does the game show an alert when failed the game?
-Does the game show an alert when the game is won?
-Does the game allow you to restart once you have either won or lost the game?
-Does the sound effects work when a button is pressed?
-Do the buttons flash when pressed or called by the sequence?
